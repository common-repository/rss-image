= How do I view my feed to verify it worked? =

1. You can try simply looking at your feed: https://example.com/feed/. Depending on your browser, a number of things might happen, including an error, showing you the source code, prompting you to download or subscribe to the feed, or ideally, it'll simply show you the feed in a human-readable way. If not, you may need to look for browser add-on (like: [addons.mozilla.org/addon/livemarks](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/livemarks/)).
2. You can validate your RSS feed via [validator.w3.org/feed](https://validator.w3.org/feed/) or [rssboard.org/rss-validator](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-validator/).
3. You might also need to clear your site cache, but if you're still struggling, you can ask me for help at [github.com/bhadaway/support](https://github.com/bhadaway/support).
